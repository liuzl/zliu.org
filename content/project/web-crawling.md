Web crawling is at the core of many data businesses. Whether you call it web crawling, web or screen scraping, or mining the web, it involves going to sites or json apis on the web, grabbing pages, and parsing them to pull out links, images, text, prices, titles, email addresses, and numerous other page attributes.
